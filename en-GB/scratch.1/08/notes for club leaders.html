<h2>Some things to be aware of</h2>
<p>Some people have reported that they had an issue with getting the pen to draw a consistent line. This is because when the stage is not full screen, the act of clicking on a sprite and dragging is captured by the Scratch environment because it assumes you are trying to move the sprite, so the events are not handled by your code correctly. (If this is the problem you were seeing, you'll find that running the paintbox in full screen makes the problem go away). The solution? When you edit the pencil sprite and 'Set costume center' in step 1, make sure you set the center to be a transparent pixel (i.e. a point just left and down from the tip of the pencil). By doing this, when your code moves the sprite to the cursor's position, the mouse drag won't get captured by the Scratch environment.</p>
