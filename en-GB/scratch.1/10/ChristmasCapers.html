<h2>STEP 1: Make Rudolph fly</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start a new Scratch project. Delete the cat by right-clicking it and selecting Delete</li>
<li>Replace the background with SkyBackground.png.</li>
<li>Use the new <strong>sprite from file</strong> button to add the Rudolph sprite to the project (use the <strong>Rudolph.png</strong> file)</li>
<li>Rename the sprite to <strong>Rudolph</strong>.</li>
<li>Make Rudolph follow the mouse by using the following script:</li>
</ol>

<section id="test-your-project" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click the green flag and move the mouse</strong>, does Rudolph follow the mouse?</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>To make the game more interesting we will add some moving snowy hills to make it look like Rudolf is flying. Use the <strong>new sprite from file</strong> button to add the Snow sprite to the project (use the <strong>SnowHills.png</strong> file).</li>
<li>Rename the sprite to <strong>Snow1</strong>.</li>
<li>Create a new variable by clicking variables and make a variable. Call it ScrollX and make it for all sprites, then uncheck the box next to it to remove it from the stage. This will be used to control how the hills move.</li>
<li>Add the following script to make the hills move:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="656b3bef73e5b9d2ac19cb5f194626b964959c00.png" alt="when FLAG clicked

    change ScrollX by -1

        set ScrollX to 0

(end forever)" /></p>

<section id="test-your-project-1" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click the green flag</strong>, do the hills move? What happens as the hills move to the side of the screen?</p>
<p>10 Let’s fix the issue with the snowy hills flickering when they reach the right of the screen. Add more hills to the stage use the <strong>new sprite from file</strong> button to add the Snow sprite to the project again (use the SnowHills.png file). 11 Rename the sprite to <strong>Snow2</strong>. 12 Add the following script to the Snow2 sprite to allow the 2nd set of hills to follow closely behind the first:</p>

<h2>STEP 2: Falling Presents</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>We now need to add in the presents for Rudolph to collect. Use the <strong>new sprite from file</strong> button to add the Present sprite to the project (use the Present.png file).</li>
<li>Rename the sprite to <strong>Present</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new variable</strong> by clicking <strong>variables</strong> . Call it <code>Stop</code> and make it for this sprite only, then uncheck the box next to it to remove it from the stage. This will be used to control when the present should be removed from the game.</li>
<li><strong>Create another variable</strong> and call it <code>Speed</code> and make it for this sprite only, then uncheck the box next to it to remove it from the stage. This will be used to control the speed that the present falls down the screen.</li>
<li>Add the following script to the <strong>Present</strong> sprite to allow it to fall from the sky. Note that we will use <code>pick random</code> to make the present appear in a different place each time.</li>
<li>By using the <code>touching [ Rudolph ]</code> command we can make the present disappear when touched, we can use this later to keep a score.</li>

<h3>Test your project</h3>
<p><strong>Click the green flag,</strong> do the presents fall from the sky? Do they disappear when Rudolph touches them or they hit the ground?</p>
<p>7 Let’s make the game more interesting by changing the colour of the presents each time they fall. Do this by using the change colour command. 8 Change the speed of each present by replacing set Speed to -1 with the pick random command, try different values such as -10 to -1. Your script should now look like this.</p>

    repeat until Stop = 1
        change y by Speed
        if y position of Present &lt; -160
            set Stop to 1

<h2>STEP 3: Scoring and Sound Effects</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Let’s change our script to keep track of a score within the game.</strong> We can then use this later to work out when the game over message should appear.</li>
<li>Create a new <strong>variable</strong> by clicking variables . Call it <code>Score</code> and make it for all sprites. Leave this variable ticked so it appears on the screen.</li>
<li>Change the script behind the <strong>Present</strong> sprite to look like this. Note we have both added sound effects with the <code>play drum</code> command and also <code>change [ score ] by 1</code> when Rudolph touches the present.</li>
</ol>

            play drum 39 for 0.2 beats

            change Score by 1
        (end if)
    (end repeat)
(end forever)" /></p>
<p>4 Let’s add some music to the game, import the sound file <strong>Jingle_Bells.mp3</strong> to the <strong>Stage</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="93b1d13f1bd93f9f60ef53541486cc7e1295bb60.png" alt="when FLAG clicked
set ScrollX to 0
set Score to 0
play sound Jingle_Bells" /></p>
<p>5 Add the following script to the <strong>Stage</strong>, this will <strong>set our score to 0</strong> when the game is started. It will also play Jingle Bells while the game is being played.</p>
<p>Note, if at first the music sounds ‘choppy’ save your project, close Scratch and then open your project again.</p>

<li><strong>Add the following script to the GameOver sprite.</strong> This will <code>hide</code> the picture when the game starts and <code>show</code> it when the GameOver message is received.</li>
