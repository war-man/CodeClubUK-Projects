<h2>Sound machine (level 5)</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In this project your students will design their own sound machine. Sorry guys but this is going to get noisy unless your students have headphones! They’ll need to think about the different parts of the machine, what sounds they make then record the sounds and build the machine in Scratch. Then when the machine is built they can write and record a tune! You’ll thank us later!</p>
