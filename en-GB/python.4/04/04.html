<section id="step-1-drawing-a-mountain" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 1: Drawing a Mountain</h1>
<p>Pick up your turtles, open IDLE, it's time to draw again. But first, look at the following three shapes: how would we draw them in python?</p>
<pre><code>_________________________

<section id="activity-checklist" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Drawing The first is easy. Like we always do, the first line of the file is always <code>from turtle import *</code> so Python knows we want to draw. Copy the program into a new file</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">
<span class="ch">from</span> turtle <span class="ch">import</span> *

<span class="kw">def</span> first():
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)

first()</code></pre>
<p>I've put it in a function because I like functions. We're going to put all the shapes in functions. The second one looks easy too, let's add it to the file we're writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit your code so it looks like the following:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">from</span> turtle <span class="ch">import</span> *

<span class="kw">def</span> first():
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)

<span class="kw">def</span> second():
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)
    left(<span class="dv">60</span>)
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)
    right(<span class="dv">120</span>)
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)
    left(<span class="dv">60</span>)
    forward(<span class="dv">30</span>)

second()</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run the code and see what it does, does it draw the right shape?. It should look like this</p>
<pre><code>            /\
           /  \
          /    \
_________/      \________</code></pre></li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-2-a-mountain-from-mountains" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 2: A mountain from mountains</h1>
<p>But how about the third shape? Although it's rather involved if we wrote out all the steps, it's actually drawing the second mountain, four times.</p>
<pre><code>            /\
         __/  \__
         \      /
____/\___/      \___/\___
</code></pre>
<p>You can see we draw the second shape, turn, draw it again, turn, draw it again, turn and draw it one last time.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-1" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Instead of writing all of the smaller movements, let's draw it by calling <code>second</code></p>
<pre><code>from turtle import *

def second():
    forward(30)
    left(60)
    forward(30)
    right(120)
    forward(30)
    left(60)
    forward(30)

def third():
    second()
    left(60)
    second()
    right(120)
    second()
    left(60)
    second()

third()</code></pre>
<p><code>third</code> looks very much like <code>second</code>, but instead of calling <code>forward</code>, we're calling <code>second</code>. If we wanted to, we could even write the fourth one, and call <code>third</code> instead. This seems like an awful lot of work still, surely we can get the computer to understand what we're doing.</p>
<p>This shape is a special shape, which you draw by drawing it over and over: The third is made up of the second, the second is made up of the first. What we really want to do is tell the computer to keep drawing it over and over again until it is done.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-3-over-and-over" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 3: Over and over</h1>
<p>We do this by splitting up the problem into two: The simple case, and the special case. The simple case is easy: it's just forward(100). The special case is a little harder, it needs to say 'Do the special case, but one less, until you get to the simple case'. It's easier to look at the code.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-2" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open a new file and write in the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import * 

def mountain(depth):
    if depth == 1: 
           forward(10)
    else:
        newdepth = depth -1
        mountain(newdepth)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth)
        right(120)
        mountain(newdepth)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth)

mountain(3)</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we've used code very similar to <code>first</code>, <code>second</code> and <code>third</code>. We use an <code>if</code> to work out if we should draw the simple case, or the special one. In the special case, we ask to draw a mountain, like how <code>third</code> called <code>second</code>, but we ask it to draw a simpler one each time, at a new depth, one less than what we started with.</p></li>
<li><p>Run it and see what happens. What happens if you try <code>mountain(1)</code>, <code>mountain(2)</code>, or <code>mountain(4)</code>?</p></li>

<li><p>Let's just add one last thing to the mountain file, change it to look like the following, adding a new function <code>snowflake</code>:</p>

snowflake(<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>)</code></pre>
<p>This picture is known as the Koch Snowflake. If you like, try playing with the angles and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>This is called a fractal, because the larger picture is made up of smaller versions of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Try running <code>snowflake(1, 50)</code>, <code>snowflake(2, 25)</code>, <code>snowflake(3, 20)</code>. The more depth, the longer it takes to draw, so remember to put <code>speed(11)</code> in to make the turtle rush!</p></li>

<p>Like before with the mountain, we have a simple case: a straight line, and a special case: draw a line with a square bump in it. We can see the third one is just like before, drawing the second one a few times.</p>
